It is important to read and install the requirements to be able to run the AI.

In a business context, a business meeting attendee could be using an advanced AI application that captures all conversations. This app not only transcribes discussions with high accuracy, but also provides a concise summary of the meeting, highlighting key points and decisions made.

In this project, OpenAI's Whisper will be used to transform speech into text. IBM Watson AI will then be used to summarize and find the key points. An application will be developed with Hugging Face Gradio as the user interface.
